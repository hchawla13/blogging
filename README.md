------------------------------OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION----------------------------------
1.Opening the application at localhost:3000
2.On clicking the row item,it takes to the individual blog item page,ie-/blog/:id,but if directly navigated to that page,it would'nt work because we're not fetching data by id,this could have been done if data were fetched by id on the next page.
---------------------------------------NOTE----------------------------------------------------

---THE DESIGN OF THE APPLICATION AND THE DEMO DATA FOR BLOG.JSON WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE GIVEN LINK:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faYrj6b2NBpUuDG_PJdK3weZi2qqL2YI

---HENCE,THE LIST OF BLOGS IS SHOWN AS IN A REACT TABLE, AND ON CLICK OF EACH ITEM OF THE LIST,YOU GO TO THAT ITEM.THAT DESGIN WAS ALSO NOT AVAILABLE,HENCE A VERY SIMPLISTIC DESIGN IS ASSUMED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-The filter applied on any column works even if the page is refreshed and would only be removed if manually removed from the filter value
